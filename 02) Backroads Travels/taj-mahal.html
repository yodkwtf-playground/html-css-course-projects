            <h1>Welcome to <span class="tour-span">Taj-Mahal</span></h1>

            <!-- secondary-title -->

            <h2>Poet Rabindranath Tagore described it as 'a teardrop on the cheek of eternity'; Rudyard Kipling as 'the embodiment of
            all things pure'; while its creator, Emperor Shah Jahan, said it made 'the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes'.
            Every year, tourists numbering more than twice the population of Agra pass through its gates to catch a
            once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of what is widely considered the most beautiful building in the world. Few leave
            disappointed.</h2>


            <!-- text -->

            <p>The Taj was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th
            child in 1631. The death of Mumtaz left the emperor so heartbroken that his hair is said to have turned grey virtually
            overnight. Construction of the Taj began the following year; although the main building is thought to have been built in
            eight years, the whole complex was not completed until 1653. Not long after it was finished, Shah Jahan was overthrown
            by his son Aurangzeb and imprisoned in Agra Fort, where for the rest of his days he could only gaze out at his creation
            through a window. Following his death in 1666, Shah Jahan was buried here alongside his beloved Mumtaz.</p>
            
            <p>In total, some 20,000 people from India and Central Asia worked on the building. Specialists were brought in from as far
            away as Europe to produce the exquisite marble screens and pietra dura (marble inlay work) made with thousands of
            semiprecious stones.</p>
            
            <p>Taj was designated a World Heritage Site in 1983 and looks nearly as immaculate today as when it was first
            constructed – though it underwent a huge restoration project in the early 20th century.</p>


            <h3>Entry & Information</h3>

            <p>The Taj can be accessed through the west and east gates. The south gate was closed to visitors in 2018 for security
            concerns but can be used to exit the Taj. The east gate generally has shorter queues. There are separate queues for men
            and women at both gates. If you are a foreigner, once you get your ticket, you can skip ahead of the lines of Indians
            waiting to get in – one perk of your pricey entry fee. It's possible to buy your tickets online in advance at
            https://asi.payumoney.com (you'll get a ₹50 discount for your troubles), but you won't save much time as you still have
            to join the main security queue. A ticket that includes entrance to the mausoleum itself cost ₹200 extra.
            
            Cameras and videos are permitted, but you can't take photographs inside the mausoleum itself. Tripods are banned.
            
            Remember to retrieve your free 500ml bottle of water and shoe covers (included in Taj ticket price). If you keep your
            ticket, you get small entry-fee discounts when visiting Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar's Tomb or the Itimad-ud-Daulah
            on the same day. Bags much bigger than a money pouch are not allowed inside; free bag storage is available. Any food or
            tobacco will be confiscated when you go through security, as will pens.</p>


            <h3>Inside the Grounds</h3>

            <p>From both the east and west gates you first enter a monumental inner courtyard with an impressive 30m red-sandstone
            gateway on the south side.
            
            The ornamental gardens are set out along classical Mughal charbagh (formal Persian garden) lines – a square quartered by
            watercourses, with an ornamental marble plinth at its centre. When the fountains are not flowing, the Taj is beautifully
            reflected in the water.
            
            The Taj Mahal itself stands on a raised marble platform at the northern end of the ornamental gardens, with its back to
            the Yamuna River. Its raised position means that the backdrop is only sky – a masterstroke of design. Purely decorative
            40m-high white minarets grace each corner of the platform. After more than three centuries they are not quite
            perpendicular, but they may have been designed to lean slightly outwards so that in the event of an earthquake they
            would fall away from the precious Taj. The red-sandstone mosque to the west is an important gathering place for Agra's
            Muslims. The identical building to the east, the jawab, was built for symmetry.
            
            The central Taj structure is made of semitranslucent white marble, carved with flowers and inlaid with thousands of
            semiprecious stones in beautiful patterns. A perfect exercise in symmetry, the four identical faces of the Taj feature
            impressive vaulted arches embellished with pietra dura scrollwork and quotations from the Quran in a style of
            calligraphy using inlaid jasper. The whole structure is topped off by four small domes surrounding the famous bulbous
            central dome.
            
            Directly below the main dome is the Cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal, an elaborate false tomb surrounded by an exquisite
            perforated marble screen inlaid with dozens of different types of semiprecious stones. Beside it, offsetting the
            symmetry of the Taj, is the Cenotaph of Shah Jahan, who was interred here with little ceremony by his usurping son
            Aurangzeb in 1666. Light is admitted into the central chamber by finely cut marble screens.
            
            The real tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan are in a basement room below the main chamber.</p>
