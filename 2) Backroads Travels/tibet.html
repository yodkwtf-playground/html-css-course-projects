          Tibet offers fabulous monasteries, breathtaking high-altitude walks,
          stunning views of the world’s highest mountains and one of the most
          likeable cultures you will ever encounter.

        <h3>A Higher Plain</h3>

        <p>
          For many visitors, the highlights of Tibet will be of a spiritual
          nature: magnificent monasteries, prayer halls of chanting monks, and
          remote cliffside meditation retreats. Tibet’s pilgrims – from local
          grandmothers murmuring mantras in temples heavy with the aromas of
          juniper incense and yak butter to hard-core professionals walking or
          prostrating themselves around Mt Kailash – are an essential part of
          this experience. Tibetans have a level of devotion and faith that
          seems to belong to an earlier, almost medieval age. It is fascinating,
          inspiring and endlessly photogenic.
        </p>

        <h3>The Roof of the World</h3>

        <p>
          Tibet's other big draw is the elemental beauty of the highest plateau
          on earth. Geography here is on a humbling scale and every view is
          illuminated with spectacular mountain light. Your trip will take you
          past glittering turquoise lakes, across huge plains dotted with yaks
          and nomads’ tents, and over high passes draped with colourful prayer
          flags. Hike past the ruins of remote hermitages, stare open-mouthed at
          the north face of Everest or make an epic overland trip along some of
          the world’s wildest roads. The scope for adventure is limited only by
          your ability to get permits.
        </p>

        <h3>Politics & Permits</h3>

        <p>
          There’s no getting away from politics here. Whether you see Tibet as
          an oppressed, occupied nation or an underdeveloped province of China,
          the normal rules of Chinese travel simply don’t apply. Restrictions
          require foreign travellers to pre-arrange a tour with a guide and
          transport for their time in Tibet, making independent travel
          impossible. On the plus side, new airports, boutique hotels and paved
          roads offer a level of comfort unheard of just a few years ago, so if
          the rigours of Tibetan travel have deterred you in the past, now might
          be the time to reconsider.
        </p>

        <h3>A Higher Plain</h3>

        <p>
          Whatever your interests, your lasting memories of Tibet are likely to
          be of the bottle of Lhasa Beer you shared in a teahouse, the
          yak-butter tea offered by a monk in a remote monastery or the picnic
          enjoyed with a herding family on the shores of a remote lake. Always
          ready with a disarming smile, and with great tolerance and openness of
          heart despite decades of political turmoil and hardship, the people
          truly make travelling in Tibet a profound joy. Make sure you budget
          time away from your pre-planned tour itinerary to take advantage of
          these chance encounters.
