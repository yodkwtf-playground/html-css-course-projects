            <h3>Stirring Landscapes</h3>

            <p>When you think of Africa, you’re probably thinking of Kenya. It’s the lone acacia silhouetted on the savannah against a
            horizon stretching into eternity. It’s the snow-capped mountain almost on the equator and within sight of harsh deserts.
            It’s the lush, palm-fringed coastline of the Indian Ocean, it’s the Great Rift Valley that once threatened to tear the
            continent asunder, and it’s the dense forests reminiscent of the continent’s heart. In short, Kenya is a country of epic
            landforms that stir our deepest longings for this very special continent.</p>


            <h3>Proud Peoples</h3>

            <p>Filling the country's landscape, adding depth and resonance to Kenya’s age-old story, are some of Africa’s best-known
            peoples. The Maasai, the Samburu, the Turkana, the Swahili, the Kikuyu: these are the peoples whose histories and daily
            struggles tell the story of a country and of a continent – the struggle to maintain traditions as the modern world
            crowds in, the daily fight for survival in some of the harshest environments on earth, the ancient tension between those
            who farm and those who roam. Drawing near to these cultures could just be a highlight of your visit.</p>


            <h3>Abundant Wildlife</h3>

            <p>Kenya is the land of the Masai Mara, of wildebeest and zebras migrating in their millions with the great predators of
            Africa following in their wake, of endangered species like black rhinos managing to maintain their precarious foothold.
            But Kenya is also home to the red elephants of Tsavo, to Amboseli elephant families in the shadow of Mt Kilimanjaro and
            to the massed millions of pink flamingos stepping daintily through lake shallows. Africa is the last great wilderness
            where these creatures survive. And Kenya is the perfect place to answer Africa’s call of the wild.</p>


            <h3>Conservation's Home</h3>

            <p>The abundance of Kenya's wildlife owes everything to one of Africa's most innovative and successful conservation
            communities. Through some pretty tough love – Kenya pioneered using armed rangers to protect rhinos and elephants –
            Kenya stopped the emptying of its wilderness and brought its wildlife back from the brink after the poaching holocaust
            of the 1970s and 1980s. More than that, in places like Laikipia and the Masai Mara, private and community conservancies
            fuse tourism with community development and wildlife conservation to impressive effect. In other words, if you want your
            visit to make a difference, you've come to the right place.</p>
