            <h3>Neighbourhoods & Islands</h3>

            <p>Hong Kong's enchanting neighbourhoods and islands offer a sensory feast. You may find yourself swaying along on a
            historic double-decker tram, cheering with the hordes at the city-centre horse races, or simply gazing out at the
            glorious harbour. What most visitors don't immediately realise is that over 70% of Hong Kong is mountains and sprawling
            country parks, some also home to geological and historical gems. Escape the city limits on one of the world’s smoothest
            transport systems and spend your day wandering in a Song dynasty village, hiking on a deserted island or kayaking among
            volcanic sea arches.</p>


            <h3>Cuisine</h3>

            <p>One of the world's top culinary capitals, the city that worships the God of Cookery has many a demon in the kitchen,
            whether the deliciousness in the pot is Cantonese, Sichuanese, Japanese or French. So deep is the city's love of food
            and so broad its culinary repertoire that whatever your gastronomic desires, Hong Kong will find a way to sate them. The
            answer could be a bowl of wonton noodles, freshly steamed dim sum, a warm pineapple bun wedged with butter, a pair of
            the sweetest prawns, your first-ever stinky tofu, or the creations of the latest celebrity chef.</p>


            <h3>Shopping</h3>

            <p>From off-the-rack Chinese gowns to bespoke speciality knives (and vice versa), the sheer variety of products in Hong
            Kong’s shops is dizzying. Every budget, need and whim is catered for in 'can do' spirit by a similarly impressive
            assortment of venues: glitzy malls where the moneyed shop, chic side-street boutiques and vintage dens where
            fashionistas find their gems, nerdy gadget bazaars, and a mix of markets where you can haggle to your heart’s content.
            The city has no sales tax so prices are generally attractive to visitors.</p>


            <h3>Culture</h3>

            <p>Underneath the glass and steel of Hong Kong’s commercial persona is a dynamic cultural landscape where its Chinese
            roots, colonial connections and the contributions of its home-grown talent become intertwined. Here you’re just as
            likely to find yourself dissecting art in the dizzying number of contemporary galleries as joining in dawn taichi or
            reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music by the
            harbour or Chinese opera in a bamboo theatre, not to mention the thousands of shows staged year-round at the city's many
            museums and concert halls.</p>
